Understanding and deriving neural and synaptic plasticity rules that can enable hidden weights to learn is an ongoing quest in neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering. From a machine learning perspective, **locality** and **differentiability** are key issues of the spiking neuron model operations. In this [poster presentation](files/cosyn_decolle_poster.pdf), it is shown that deep learning algorithms that locally approximate the gradient backpropagation updates using locally synthesized gradients overcome this challenge.
