Graduated with an international Master degree in computer graphics, vision and robotics, I am currently working as a [robotic engineer in FZI](https://www.fzi.de/de/wir-ueber-uns/organisation/mitarbeiter/address/jacques-kaiser/) and simultaneously pursuing a PhD within the Human Brain Project.
Throughout my studies, I lived and worked in five different countries - France, England, Australia, USA and Germany. 

Aside from my studies, I have cumulated years of experience working in web development for startups. Proficient full-stack developer, I pick up new technologies very quickly.
