Professionally
-----

I completed a PhD at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) focusing on [neuromorphic vision and learning in spiking neural networks](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000122690), funded by the Humain Brain Project and a DAAD scolarship.
Simultaneously, I have been working over five years at [FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik](https://www.fzi.de/en/home/), developing robot demonstrators using ROS for [various projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyq1PZAck50&ab_channel=FZIchannel).
Previously, I was a full-stack web developer for [start-ups](/work-experiences/).

Personally
-----

I was born in France, but spent my last years in foreign countries: England, Australia and Germany.
Aside from programming, I am also developing my handicraft skills by [converting a van into a camper](https://vanderfool.com).
